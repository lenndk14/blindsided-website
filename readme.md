# Website Blindsided Records

This is my first attempt at designing and coding a full website. The website is made for a friend of mine who is the owner of Blindsided Records, and is not used at the moment because there is no webshop yet. I used WordPress as a headless CMS. When the site goes online the contact page will actually work.

## Event Planner

Using custom posts in WordPress the owner will be able to add live music events to the calendar, which will be viewable to the visitor of the website. The event calendar uses HTML-requests to fetch JSON data from the WordPress back-end and filters them displaying only the data for the current selected month. This makes it easy for the owner to add new events without a lot of knowledge about the website.
